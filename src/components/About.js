          My coding journey began two years ago during an internship in a Fraud
          team where I picked up SQL. That experience hooked me on programming!
          üòç I started with front-end technologies, then moved on to back-end
          development to become a well-rounded full-stack developer. I‚Äôm a
          curious, friendly, and motivated person who loves creating beautiful
          things and exploring new technologies. Now, I‚Äôm looking forward to my
          next adventure as a full-stack developer.
